## About me

Hello! My name is Duan, and I am a web designer based in Winnipeg. I am passionate about creating visually appealing, user-friendly websites that deliver seamless digital experiences.

Before moving to Canada, I worked in IT as a product manager in China, where I focused on understanding user needs and translating them into functional and aesthetically pleasing designs. My interest in web design led me to study software development at MITT in Winnipeg, where I'm focused on improving my front-end and user experience design skills.

I love exploring design trends, color theory, and layout principles to create designs that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and easy to use. I enjoy working on projects that involve responsive design, making websites accessible on all devices.

Feel free to explore my GitHub to see some of the web design projects I have worked on. If you'd like to know more, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
