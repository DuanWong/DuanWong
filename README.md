## About me

Hello! My name is Duan, and I am from China. I grew up in a small town in central China. I came to Canada from China last year.

When I was in China, I worked in IT. I was a product manager responsible for collecting customer requirements and designing product prototypes. I am currently a student at MIT, studying software development. Because I want to learn about software development knowledge in depth, hoping that I can develop software by myself in the future.

Specifically, I am very interested in robots and artificial intelligence. This is also related to my job in China. We developed robots for large factories that work with workers, and even in some places, all the work was done by robots. I think robots will play an increasingly important role in human society. At the same time, working in this industry is also interesting and valuable.

If you want to know more about me, please contact me!
